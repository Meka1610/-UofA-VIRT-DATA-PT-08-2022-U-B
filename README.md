Kickstarter-analysis
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is an up-and-coming play writer who has a play called “Fever”. She completed her first crowdfunding campaign and nearly met her goal. She would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 


### Purpose

Understand crowdfunding campaign from start to finish. Organize, sort, and analyze other crowdfunding data to determine if specific factors  have made previous crowdfunding campaigns successful based on their launch date and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

Please see the explanation below:


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I performed my analysis of the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Launch Date by completing the pivot tables for each. 
For the first chart  I placed Parent Category and Years and Filter section. In the legend (series) I placed outcomes. Axis or categories I placed Date (created conversion). Finally for the values portion I place count of years.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I completed a similar process with a pivot table for the graph below marked Outcomes Based on Launch Date. For filters section I used parent category and years. The legend or series section I used outcomes. For the axis or categories section I used date created conversion. In closing for values I used count of outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Countif formula roved to be challenging at first. My original numbers I pulled from on the Kickstarter sheet was incorrect. Taking a step back and talking my way through this portion to my husband help me realize my error.  Completing my first initial pivot table was challenging. Slow and steady proved to be the key and thinking logically about the layout of the charts.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

I concluded that the two most successful months were May and June in terms of successfully launching campaigns. Based on the numbers they had the highest successful turn out number being 111 and 100. In retrospect the two worst months to launch a campaign were during November and December. One can see from the line chart that the success rate decline as you progress from summer into winter. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I conclude that success occurred when the goal was set no higher than $4999 and below. The highest success percentage was 75. Obtaining a goal of less than $1000 is extremely successful. Another interesting outcome based on the goals diagram, the large the amount of money one tried to achieve the success number declined. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Because the data was collected from various countries, how do we know if the information collected was reported in a consistent manner across different regions of the world? This would affect the data and our findings. Are we to assume that the collection process was inherently the same from country to country. 
Perhaps economic conditions may have factored into several of the goals and if they were successful vs failed. For example, if a crowdfunded campaign emerged during today economics times would it be successful vs period in the data from 2014 to 2017?

A limitation could be the size of the data being analyzed. If we had a larger amount of data would it paint a more clear picture visually? Should we be looking at a wider time period to build a stronger analysis because its over a larger period of time with more data to pull information. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Scatter plot, because we have a massive amount of date that may better represent the information in a more succinct visual aid.
